## üë®‚Äçüíº About Me

I'm currently pursuing Masters in Artificial Intelligence at University at Buffalo, and actively looking for Full-Time opportunities in Machine Learning, and Data Science. I love working with Large Lanuage Models, and Fine tuning of LLMs using PEFT techniques like LoRA is area that specially piques my interest. In my current research I have been able to finetune RoBERTa architecture to classify nouns into previous undefined categories like Shape and Non-Shape Nouns, and verbs in Result and Manner verbs using my own annotated large corpus of 2.5 million words. I am working towards leveraging RLHF technique to Supervise Fine Tune LlaMA model to perform similar calssification tasks which will enable to create an explainable model.

- **üî≠ Current Work:** Developing multimodal Active Speaker Localization and Child Speech Modelling in the UB Deep Learning Lab.
- **üå± Learning:** Advanced NLP techniques, Multimodal Machine Learning, Large Language Models, Speech Processing, and Human Pose Estimation.
- **üëØ Looking to Collaborate On:** Innovative projects involving RAG systems, and LLM Fine Tuning.
